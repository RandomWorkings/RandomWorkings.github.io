                    The Fungrounds are a series of game modes, mostly noncombative, whose purpose is to create PUBG games that change up the formula of a normal PUBG match by throwing out all the rules and replacing them with our own.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    The main goal of most of these modes is to allow a large group of people to take part in competitive matches and to have some “stupid fun” with friends without having to worry too much about player survival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even the modes that do have a survival element should be different enough from a normal PUBG match in setup that everyone can still have a laugh while taking part.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    Another key aspect to the Fungrounds is that your teammates are not necessarily your team members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some modes will have you working together with all your team members, but others will see those allies become just as much part of your competition.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    Communication is key for these sorts of games to go as smoothly as possible so make sure at least one of your team members can hear the stream so that you can receive, delayed, instructions and any last minute rule/setup changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having the stream chat open is also useful for sending the game runner messages from your team.
